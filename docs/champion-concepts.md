## 1. Kaelith, the Echo Walker

**Role:** Assassin / Fighter
**Theme:** A warrior unstuck in time, leaving temporal afterimages that repeat her actions.

**Lore:** Once a royal bodyguard who stepped into a fractured time rift to save her queen. Now she exists in multiple moments simultaneously, her past selves echoing her every move.

### Passive: Temporal Resonance
Every 3rd ability cast leaves behind an **Echo** at Kaelith's location. Echoes last 4 seconds and repeat the next basic ability Kaelith casts at 60% effectiveness. Echoes can be consumed by walking through them to reduce ability cooldowns by 1 second.

### Q: Rift Slash
Kaelith dashes forward and slashes in an arc, dealing physical damage. If an Echo exists, it performs the same slash 0.5 seconds later.

- Cooldown: 6s
- Synergy: Use Q to create Echo (passive), then Q again for double slash

### W: Moment Snare
Kaelith marks a target location. After 1.5 seconds, all enemies in the area are briefly frozen as time catches up to them. Echoes in the area detonate, dealing bonus damage per Echo consumed.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Place Echoes in area first, then detonate with W

### E: Rewind Step
Kaelith blinks to the location of her oldest Echo, destroying it and gaining a shield. If no Echo exists, she simply blinks backward a short distance.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Leave Echo with Q, engage, E back to safety

### R: Shattered Timeline
Kaelith fractures time in a large area for 6 seconds. During this time, she generates Echoes every 1.5 seconds automatically, and all Echoes deal 100% damage instead of 60%.

- Cooldown: 100s
- Synergy: Massive Echo generation for W detonation or sustained Q damage

## 2. Velmor, the Glasswright

**Role:** Mage / Controller
**Theme:** An artisan who shapes living glass into beautiful but deadly constructs.

**Lore:** A master craftsman from the Crystal Spires whose art was deemed too dangerous. His glass creations are mesmerizing—and razor sharp.

### Passive: Fragile Beauty
Velmor's abilities create **Glass Structures**. Structures have health and can be destroyed by enemies. When destroyed, they shatter, dealing magic damage and slowing nearby enemies. Velmor can have up to 5 structures at once.

### Q: Prismatic Shard
Velmor launches a glass shard that damages and marks the first enemy hit. He can recast to create a Glass Wall at the marked enemy's location (structure).

- Cooldown: 5s
- Synergy: Mark enemy, place wall to trap them, shatter for damage

### W: Mirror Lattice
Creates a glass mirror (structure) at target location. The mirror reflects Velmor's Q shards, allowing them to bounce and hit additional enemies. Reflected shards deal reduced damage.

- Cooldown: 10s
- Synergy: Place mirror, bounce Q for multi-target poke

### E: Crystalline Cage
Velmor encases himself in a glass shell for 1.5 seconds, becoming invulnerable but unable to act. When the shell breaks, it becomes a Glass Structure at his location. Can recast early to break out.

- Cooldown: 18s
- Synergy: Use defensively, leaves structure for passive shatter

### R: Masterwork
Velmor channels for 2 seconds, then all Glass Structures on the map simultaneously shatter with 200% damage and a larger radius. For the next 6 seconds, Velmor's abilities create structures instantly without travel time.

- Cooldown: 90s
- Synergy: Build up structures, detonate all at once

## 3. Thistle, the Untamed Garden

**Role:** Support / Mage
**Theme:** A sentient plant colony that spreads across the battlefield, growing different flora for various effects.

**Lore:** Not one being but many—a collective consciousness of invasive magical plants that escaped a druid's greenhouse. They speak in whispers of rustling leaves.

### Passive: Deep Roots
Thistle plants **Seeds** with abilities. Seeds grow over 3 seconds into full **Plants**. Fully grown plants have enhanced effects. Thistle gains bonus movement speed when walking through areas with Plants.

### Q: Bloomspore
Plants a seed that grows into a **Healing Flower**. Nearby allies regenerate health over time. Fully grown: Also cleanses one debuff when an ally enters the area.

- Cooldown: 8s
- Synergy: Plant early for full growth, combine with W for area control

### W: Tanglevine
Plants a seed that grows into a **Grasping Vine**. Enemies moving through are slowed. Fully grown: Enemies are rooted for 1 second on first contact.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Trap enemies in W, keep them near Q for ally sustain

### E: Sporeburst
Thistle releases spores in an area. If spores hit a Plant, that Plant immediately grows to full maturity and releases a burst effect (heal burst for Q, root burst for W).

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Instant plant maturation for emergency effects

### R: Overgrowth
Thistle becomes immobile and channels for 4 seconds, rapidly growing Plants across a large area. Creates 3 Healing Flowers and 2 Grasping Vines in strategic positions. After channeling, Thistle's next 3 abilities have no cooldown.

- Cooldown: 120s
- Synergy: Massive battlefield control setup

## 4. Marros, the Debt Collector

**Role:** Fighter / Tank
**Theme:** A cursed merchant who trades in borrowed power—taking now, paying later.

**Lore:** Made a deal with something ancient for unlimited strength. The fine print: everything borrowed must be repaid with interest. Now he survives by passing his debts to others.

### Passive: Compound Interest
When Marros takes damage, 30% is converted to **Debt** instead. Debt slowly converts to true damage over 10 seconds. Killing enemies clears Debt. Maximum Debt equal to 40% of max health—excess becomes immediate damage.

### Q: Loan Shark
Marros strikes an enemy, dealing physical damage and **borrowing** 10% of their current Armor and Magic Resist for 5 seconds. The target's stats are reduced by the same amount. Can stack up to 3 times on different targets.

- Cooldown: 6s
- Synergy: Borrow stats to survive and tank, repay by killing

### W: Foreclosure
Marros transfers 50% of his current Debt to a target enemy over 2 seconds (tether). If the tether completes, the enemy takes the Debt as immediate damage. If they break the tether, Marros takes the Debt as damage.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Build up Debt with passive, transfer to enemy for burst

### E: Collateral
Marros dashes to a target ally or enemy. If ally: Marros takes 40% of damage they receive for 3 seconds. If enemy: Marros and the enemy are bound—damage dealt to either is split between both.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Use on enemy, then W to force them to take shared Debt damage

### R: Bankruptcy
Marros declares bankruptcy, instantly clearing all Debt and becoming invulnerable for 1.5 seconds. However, for the next 20 seconds, his passive no longer converts damage to Debt—he takes full damage. Killing an enemy champion during this time ends the penalty early.

- Cooldown: 80s
- Synergy: Emergency survival, high-risk window to secure kills

## 5. Zhen-Yi, the Paper Dancer

**Role:** Assassin / Mage
**Theme:** A martial artist who fights with enchanted paper—folding origami weapons mid-combat.

**Lore:** Last practitioner of a forbidden paper-folding art. Each fold channels magic into deadly constructs. Her paper cranes carry the souls of her fallen temple.

### Passive: Thousand Folds
Zhen-Yi generates **Paper** over time (max 100). Abilities consume Paper. Having more Paper when casting increases ability damage/effects up to 50% bonus at full Paper. Paper generation doubles while out of combat.

### Q: Crane Strike
Zhen-Yi folds a paper crane and launches it at target direction. The crane flies in a straight line, damaging enemies. At max range or on recast, the crane circles back to Zhen-Yi, damaging enemies again.

- Cost: 15 Paper
- Cooldown: 4s
- Synergy: Low cost, spam for damage, conserve Paper for big plays

- Cost: 30 Paper
- Cooldown: 10s
- Synergy: Zone control, higher Paper = more damage

### E: Paper Tiger
Zhen-Yi folds herself into a paper tiger, gaining a large burst of movement speed and the ability to pass through enemies. The next attack after transforming back deals bonus damage based on distance traveled as a tiger.

- Cost: 25 Paper
- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Chase, escape, or reposition for crane return damage

### R: Thousand Crane Storm
Zhen-Yi expends ALL remaining Paper to fold a storm of cranes around her. For 4 seconds, cranes spiral outward continuously, dealing damage to all enemies hit. More Paper spent = longer duration and more damage.

- Cost: All Paper
- Cooldown: 90s
- Synergy: Save 100 Paper for maximum devastation

## 6. Orbis, the Gravity Well

**Role:** Tank / Controller
**Theme:** A fragment of a collapsed star given human form, bending gravity to protect and disrupt.

**Lore:** When the Fell Star collapsed, one fragment achieved consciousness. Orbis wanders the world, his mere presence warping space around him, searching for purpose.

### Passive: Mass Influence
Orbis has a **Gravity Aura** around him (medium radius). Enemies in the aura are slightly slowed. Allies in the aura are slightly faster. The aura's strength increases based on Orbis's bonus health.

### Q: Singularity
Orbis creates a gravity well at target location. Enemies are slowly pulled toward the center over 2 seconds. The pull is stronger the closer they are to the center. Enemies at the very center are briefly stunned.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Pull enemies into passive aura, set up for W

### W: Mass Driver
Orbis launches himself in a direction, heavily slowing himself during the charge. On impact with terrain or max range, he creates a shockwave. Enemies recently affected by Singularity take bonus damage and are knocked back.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Use Q to pull enemies together, then W for AoE damage

### E: Gravitational Shield
Orbis bends gravity around a target ally, giving them a shield. While shielded, projectiles curve away from the ally, reducing their damage by 40%. Orbis can self-cast.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Protect carry while using Q/W offensively

### R: Event Horizon
Orbis channels for 1 second, then dramatically increases his Gravity Aura radius and strength for 6 seconds. During this time, enemies cannot dash or blink out of the aura, and the slow is much stronger. Allies gain even more movement speed.

- Cooldown: 110s
- Synergy: Lock down teamfight, prevent escapes, combo with Q

## 7. Whisper, the Dream Thief

**Role:** Mage / Assassin
**Theme:** A nightmare given form that slips between the waking world and dreams.

**Lore:** Born from the collective nightmares of a plague-stricken city. Whisper feeds on fear, growing stronger as minds fracture around him.

### Passive: Nightmare Fuel
Enemy champions near Whisper generate **Dread** over time (shown as a meter above their heads). At maximum Dread (reached after ~8 seconds), they become **Terrified**—their screen darkens slightly and Whisper's abilities deal 25% bonus damage to them. Dread decays when away from Whisper.

### Q: Sleep Paralysis
Whisper sends out a slow-moving dark projectile. If it hits an enemy champion, they are slowed and silenced for 1.5 seconds. Terrified targets are also blinded for the duration.

- Cooldown: 8s
- Synergy: Stay near enemy to build Dread, then Q for enhanced effect

### W: Fade to Black
Whisper becomes intangible for 1.5 seconds, unable to attack or be attacked. While intangible, he moves 30% faster and passes through terrain. Exiting near a Terrified enemy deals damage.

- Cooldown: 18s
- Synergy: Use to stay near enemies, building Dread, then burst Terrified targets

### E: Night Terror
Whisper curses target enemy, dealing damage over 3 seconds. If the target becomes Terrified during this time, they also flee away from Whisper in fear for 1 second.

- Cooldown: 10s
- Synergy: Apply E, stay near, when Dread maxes they flee

### R: Realm of Dreams
Whisper pulls all nearby enemy champions into a nightmare realm for 4 seconds. In this realm, only Whisper and the affected enemies exist—no outside help. All enemies inside instantly gain maximum Dread. If an enemy dies in the realm, the nightmare ends early and all surviving enemies are stunned for 1 second.

- Cooldown: 120s
- Synergy: Instant Dread application, isolation for picks

## 8. Cadence, the Sound Shaper

**Role:** Support / Mage
**Theme:** A musician who discovered that all matter vibrates—and learned to conduct those vibrations.

**Lore:** A deaf prodigy who perceives the world through vibrations. Her music is silent but deadly, each note a calculated frequency that can shatter stone or mend flesh.

### Passive: Resonance

- Cooldown: 4s

**Lore:** Carved as a sentinel for a forgotten kingdom, Rook has outlived everything he protected. Now he seeks new walls to defend, new people to shelter behind his stone.

Rook's abilities create **Stone Segments**. Segments act as terrain—blocking movement and projectiles. Rook can have up to 6 segments. Allies standing near Segments gain bonus armor. Segments last 8 seconds or until destroyed.

## 11. Vessel, the Hollow Saint

**Role:** Support / Tank

**Lore:** The saint within the armor died centuries ago, but their devotion remained. The empty vessel now walks the land, driven by an echo of purpose—to sacrifice everything for others.

### Passive: Martyrdom
Vessel has no natural health regeneration. Instead, when an ally takes damage near Vessel, it absorbs 15% of that damage onto itself. Vessel can exceed its max health through absorption (up to 150%), represented as **Borrowed Life**.

**Role:** Fighter / Mage
**Theme:** A creature that feeds on bad luck and curses, turning misfortune into power.

### Passive: Curse Stomach

## 13. Mirage, the Sand Phantom

**Role:** Assassin / Mage
**Theme:** A being of living sand that creates decoys and illusions, never where you expect.

**Lore:** The desert plays tricks on the mind—Mirage is the desert's favorite trick given form. She is the shimmer on the horizon, the false oasis, the footsteps behind you that vanish when you turn.

### Passive: Heat Shimmer
When Mirage hasn't taken damage for 3 seconds, she becomes **Shimmering**—slightly transparent and gaining 15% movement speed. Taking damage breaks the shimmer. While Shimmering, her next ability creates a **Decoy** at her position.

---

## 14. Anchor, the Depth Warden

**Role:** Tank / Fighter
**Theme:** A drowned sailor fused with his ship's anchor, dragging enemies to a watery grave.

**Lore:** Captain of a vessel that sank in a storm, Anchor refused to let go. The sea took him anyway—but gave him back wrong. Now he drags others down, unable to rest until the ocean is satisfied.

### Passive: Pressure of the Deep
Enemies near Anchor are under **Pressure**. The longer they stay near him, the more Pressure builds (stacks every second, max 5). Each Pressure stack reduces enemy movement speed by 4% and reduces their armor by 3. Pressure decays when away from Anchor.

### Q: Chain Drag
Anchor throws his chain in a line. First enemy champion hit is chained for 3 seconds—they cannot move further than a set distance from Anchor. Anchor can recast to pull them toward him (slow pull, not instant). Chained enemies gain Pressure twice as fast.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Chain enemy, build Pressure, drag them in

- Cooldown: 110s
- Synergy: Ultimate Pressure buildup for teamfight lockdown

## 15. Ember, the Dying Flame

**Role:** Mage / Support
**Theme:** A fire spirit near extinction, burning brightest when closest to death.

**Lore:** Once a roaring wildfire, Ember has burned for centuries. Now just a flicker remains, yet that flicker refuses to die. The smaller the flame, the more desperately—and dangerously—it burns.

### Passive: Final Flare
Ember's ability damage scales inversely with her current health. At full health, abilities deal 80% damage. At 1% health, abilities deal 150% damage. Additionally, when Ember falls below 25% health, she ignites, dealing damage to nearby enemies each second.

### Q: Kindle
Ember throws a spark at target location, dealing magic damage and leaving a **Cinder** (lasts 6 seconds). Enemies standing on a Cinder take damage over time. Ember standing on a Cinder slowly heals.

- Cooldown: 5s
- Synergy: Create safe zones for sustain, or traps for enemies

### W: Fan the Flames
Ember consumes all Cinders on the field, dealing damage to enemies near each consumed Cinder. For each Cinder consumed, Ember gains a burst of ability power for 4 seconds. Self-damages Ember for 5% current health per Cinder.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Place Cinders, consume for burst, get lower HP = more damage

- Cooldown: 10s

### R: Supernova
Ember channels for 1.5 seconds, then explodes, dealing massive damage in a huge area—but sets her health to 1. For the next 4 seconds, Ember is untargetable and regenerates health. If she takes lethal damage during regeneration, she dies.

- Synergy: Ultimate risk/reward, maximum passive damage after cast

**Lore:** For thirty years, Aldric led the ram crews that broke open castle gates across the realm. When his beloved ram "Thunderhead" was set ablaze with him inside, he emerged fused with its iron head and oak frame. Now he IS the siege engine—a walking battering ram that no wall can withstand.

### Passive: Momentum
Aldric builds **Momentum** while moving in the same direction (stacks every 0.5s, max 10). Each stack increases his next ability's damage by 5% and his movement speed by 2%. Changing direction or stopping resets Momentum. Being stunned resets Momentum.

- Cooldown: 10s

### W: Ironclad
Aldric raises his ram-head as a shield, reducing frontal damage by 50% for 2 seconds. Enemies who attack him from the front during this time are slowed. At the end, Aldric slams down, dealing damage in a cone.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Use while building Momentum to survive approach

### E: Splintering Blow
Aldric slams the ground, sending wooden splinters outward. Enemies hit take physical damage and receive **Splinters** (3 stacks). Basic attacks against splintered enemies consume stacks and deal bonus damage.

### R: Gate Breaker
Aldric winds up for 1 second, then charges unstoppably in a direction for up to 3 seconds. He passes through all enemies, dealing massive damage to each. If he hits terrain, he breaks through it (creating a gap in player-made walls) and stuns all nearby enemies. He is immune to crowd control during the charge.

- Cooldown: 100s
- Synergy: Ultimate engage tool, counters Rook's walls

## 17. Isolde, the Plague Widow

**Role:** Mage / Support
**Theme:** A healer who lost everything to plague and now weaponizes disease against her enemies.

Now she walks the battlefield as both healer and harbinger—curing allies while inflicting plagues upon those who threaten them.

### Passive: Carrier
Isolde is immune to her own diseases. Enemies who die while diseased leave behind a **Plague Cloud** for 4 seconds. Allies walking through Plague Clouds are healed. Enemies walking through take damage over time and contract the disease.

### Q: Festering Touch

### E: Bitter Medicine
Isolde drinks a vial, choosing one of two effects:

- **Concentrate**: Deals damage to herself but her next Q deals double damage and spreads at full effectiveness

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Antidote for survival, Concentrate for burst spread

**Theme:** A former royal knight who abandoned his oath to lead a band of deserters and outlaws.

**Lore:** Once the King's champion, Garrett witnessed too many peasants burned for noble sport. He fled with his sword and his shame, gathering other deserters in the Thornwood. Now his "Court of Cowards" strikes at supply lines and rescues prisoners—traitors to the crown, heroes to the common folk.

### Passive: Outlaw's Cunning
Garrett gains **Infamy** when he damages enemy champions from behind or while unseen (max 100). At high Infamy, his abilities gain bonus effects. Infamy decays slowly over time. Killing wards grants Infamy.

### Q: Backstab
Garrett strikes with his dagger, dealing physical damage. If striking from behind, deals 50% bonus damage. At 50+ Infamy: also applies a bleed.

- Cooldown: 4s
- Synergy: Position behind enemies, build Infamy for enhanced Q

### W: Smoke Retreat
Garrett throws a smoke bomb at his feet, becoming invisible for 2 seconds and gaining movement speed. Attacking or casting breaks invisibility early. At 75+ Infamy: leaving invisibility grants a shield.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Use to reposition behind enemies for Q

### E: Rally the Deserters
Garrett calls upon his outlaw band. A ghostly deserter appears and attacks the nearest enemy champion for 4 seconds, dealing physical damage. The deserter prioritizes Garrett's attack target. At 100 Infamy: two deserters appear instead.

- Cooldown: 18s
- Synergy: Summons scale with Infamy, provide distraction for backstabs

### R: Traitor's Gambit
Garrett marks an enemy champion as his target for 8 seconds. During this time, all damage Garrett deals to the target from behind is doubled, and killing the target fully restores his Infamy. If the target survives, Garrett loses all Infamy.

- Cooldown: 80s
- Synergy: All-in assassination tool, high risk/reward

## 19. Brother Clement, the Flagellant

**Role:** Tank / Support
**Theme:** A fanatical monk who punishes himself to absolve the sins of others.

**Lore:** The monastery of St. Aldhelm teaches that pain purifies. Brother Clement took this further than any—whipping himself for the sins of others, taking their guilt into his scarred flesh. His suffering has made him nearly immune to pain, and his faith makes him terrifying on the battlefield.

### Passive: Mortification of the Flesh
When Clement takes damage, he gains stacks of **Penance** (1 stack per 5% health lost, max 10). Penance stacks increase his armor and magic resist by 3 each. Stacks decay slowly when out of combat.

### Q: Absolution
Clement lashes himself with his flail, dealing damage to himself and gaining 3 Penance stacks. For the next 3 seconds, his basic attacks deal bonus magic damage and heal allies near the struck enemy.

- Cooldown: 6s
- Synergy: Self-damage builds passive, enables ally healing

### W: Take Upon Thyself
Clement links to an ally for 4 seconds. All damage the ally would take is redirected to Clement instead. Clement gains 1 Penance stack for each instance of damage redirected. Cannot reduce Clement below 1 HP.

- Cooldown: 18s
- Synergy: Protect ally while building massive Penance stacks

### E: Zealot's Fury
Clement charges forward a short distance, stunning the first enemy hit for 1 second. Damage dealt is increased by 10% for each Penance stack. After charging, Clement loses 3 Penance stacks.

- Cooldown: 10s
- Synergy: Build Penance, spend for burst damage

### R: Martyrdom
Clement kneels and prays for 2 seconds, becoming unable to move or act. During this time, he is invulnerable and all damage that would be dealt to nearby allies is instead dealt to him (he takes the damage after invulnerability ends). After the prayer, Clement releases a holy nova that heals allies and damages enemies based on damage absorbed.

- Cooldown: 100s
- Synergy: Ultimate team protection, massive heal/damage potential

## 20. Helga, the Executioner

**Role:** Fighter / Tank
**Theme:** The royal executioner who carries out sentences on the battlefield as she did on the block.

**Lore:** For twenty years, Helga's axe has separated heads from shoulders at the King's command. She knows the weight of a life—she's ended hundreds. When war came, the King pointed her toward the enemy. She does not fight with rage or pleasure, only cold professional certainty. Everyone meets the axe eventually.

### Passive: Death Sentence
Enemies below 25% health are marked with **Condemned**. Helga's basic attacks against Condemned enemies deal 15% bonus damage and cannot miss. When a Condemned enemy dies near Helga (regardless of who killed them), she heals for 5% of her max health.

### Q: Cleaving Strike
Helga swings her greataxe in a wide arc, dealing physical damage to all enemies hit. Condemned enemies take additional execution damage (bonus damage based on their missing health).

- Cooldown: 7s
- Synergy: Get enemies low, Q to execute with bonus damage

### W: The Block
Helga plants her axe in the ground, becoming immobile but gaining 40% damage reduction for 2 seconds. Enemies who attack her during this time are slowed. At the end, she pulls the axe up in an overhead swing that knocks up nearby enemies.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Survive burst, knock up for team follow-up

### E: Drag to Execution
Helga hooks an enemy with her axe and drags them toward her over 1 second (they can act but cannot move away). If the enemy is Condemned, they are also silenced during the drag.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Drag low HP targets in for execution

### R: Final Verdict
Helga raises her axe and brings it down on a single target after a 1-second wind-up. Deals massive physical damage. If the target is Condemned AND below 15% health, this ability executes them instantly regardless of remaining health. If the execute fails, the cooldown is reduced by 50%.

- Cooldown: 90s
- Synergy: True execute ultimate, rewards getting enemies low first

## 21. Oswin, the War Inventor

**Role:** Mage / Support
**Theme:** A brilliant but unstable engineer who builds deadly contraptions mid-battle.

**Lore:** Oswin was the King's siege engineer until an "accident" killed a dozen nobles (he insists the trebuchet was calibrated correctly). Exiled, he now sells his genius to whoever pays—or whoever lets him build the really dangerous devices. His creations are equal parts brilliant and terrifying.

### Passive: Jury Rigged
Oswin can place up to 3 **Contraptions** on the battlefield. Contraptions have health and can be destroyed. When Oswin is near his Contraptions, they activate. When he's away, they go dormant. Contraptions can be upgraded by casting the same ability on them (max 2 upgrades).

If it reaches its target, it explodes spectacularly.

- Cooldown: 120s
- Synergy: Ultimate siege/teamfight tool

## 22. Dame Rowena, the Oathbound

**Role:** Fighter / Tank
**Theme:** A knight bound by magical oaths that grant power but demand sacrifice.

**Lore:** When Rowena swore her knight's oath, an ancient being listened. Now every promise she makes becomes binding law—break an oath and she dies, keep it and she gains power beyond mortal knights. She speaks carefully, for every word might become a chain or a weapon.

### Passive: Words of Power
Rowena's abilities create **Oaths**. Active Oaths empower her but come with conditions. Breaking an Oath's condition deals damage to Rowena. She can have up to 3 Oaths active. Oaths last until broken or manually dismissed (dismissing has no penalty).

### Q: Oath of the Blade

- Cooldown: 8s
- Synergy: Commit to a target for bonus damage

### W: Oath of the Shield

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Protect ally for shared tankiness

### E: Oath of Pursuit
Rowena swears an enemy will not escape. For 5 seconds, she gains 30% movement speed toward that enemy. If they get more than a large distance away from her, the Oath breaks (damages Rowena). If she reaches and damages them, she gains a shield.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Chase tool with risk if they escape

### R: Unbreakable Vow
Rowena speaks the ultimate oath, binding herself and a target enemy together for 6 seconds.

At the end, whoever has the lower health percentage takes heavy bonus damage.

- Cooldown: 100s
- Synergy: Duel ultimate, win the 1v1 or suffer

## 23. The Ratcatcher

**Role:** Assassin / Mage
**Theme:** A sewer-dwelling hunter of vermin who has become more rat than man.

**Lore:** Every castle has a ratcatcher—that strange figure who descends into the sewers and emerges with bags of dead vermin. The one they call Ratcatcher has worked the tunnels for so long that the line between hunter and hunted blurred. He speaks to rats now. They speak back. They're always hungry.

### Passive: Skittering Horde
Ratcatcher is always accompanied by his **Swarm** (visible as rats around him). The Swarm grants vision in a small radius and detects nearby invisible enemies. When Ratcatcher deals damage, rats from the Swarm bite the target for bonus magic damage. Swarm size increases over time out of combat (max 20 rats).

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Ambush tool, emerge for fear into Q

### E: Plague Rats

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Build up Swarm, E, then attack for stacking poison

### R: The Piper's Due
Ratcatcher plays a haunting tune on his pipe, calling ALL rats in the area to him. For 8 seconds, his Swarm is set to maximum size and rats continuously spawn around nearby enemy champions, biting them every second. Additionally, Ratcatcher can cast Q without consuming rats during this time.

- Cooldown: 100s
- Synergy: Ultimate Swarm damage, free Q spam

## 24. Siegfried, the Hollow Knight

**Role:** Tank / Fighter
**Theme:** An animated suit of armor with no one inside, driven by the loyalty of a dead knight.

**Lore:** When Sir Siegfried fell defending his lord, his devotion was so absolute that his spirit refused to leave. He rose in his armor, empty but eternal. He no longer remembers his lord's face or name—only that he must protect. He seeks a new master worthy of his deathless loyalty.

### Passive: Undying Loyalty
Siegfried can designate an ally as his **Liege** (click ally, 60s cooldown to change). While his Liege is alive, Siegfried gains 10% bonus armor and magic resist. If his Liege dies, Siegfried enters **Vengeance** for 10 seconds: gaining 30% attack speed and dealing bonus damage, but losing the defensive bonus.

### Q: Shield Bash
Siegfried bashes with his shield, dealing damage and stunning briefly. If used while facing his Liege, he intercepts the next projectile aimed at them instead of stunning.

- Cooldown: 7s
- Synergy: Offensive stun or defensive projectile block

### W: Spectral Chains
Siegfried throws a ghostly chain at an enemy, tethering them to him for 3 seconds. While tethered, if the enemy moves toward Siegfried's Liege, they are slowed heavily. If they attack the Liege, they take damage.

- Cooldown: 14s
- Synergy: Peel for Liege, punish them for attacking your carry

### E: Hollow Charge
Siegfried charges to a location. If he passes through his Liege, he carries them a short distance (they can act normally). If he charges into an enemy, he knocks them back. If both—carries Liege AND knocks back enemy.

- Cooldown: 12s
- Synergy: Reposition Liege to safety while engaging

### R: Eternal Vanguard
Siegfried plants himself in front of his Liege and cannot be moved for 4 seconds. During this time, he automatically blocks all projectiles and melee attacks aimed at the Liege from his direction. Each blocked attack deals damage back to the attacker. If no Liege is designated, Siegfried gains massively increased stats instead.

- Cooldown: 90s
- Synergy: Ultimate Liege protection

## 25. Mother Morrigan, the Crone of the Moor

**Role:** Mage / Controller
**Theme:** An ancient witch who sees fate itself and weaves doom for her enemies.

**Lore:** They say Mother Morrigan was old when the kingdom was young. From her hut on the moor, she has watched dynasties rise and fall, sometimes giving them a push. Kings send assassins; she sends them back as toads. She has seen how this war ends. She's just making sure it ends the right way.

### Passive: The Sight
Morrigan can see **Doom Threads** on enemy champions—indicators showing which direction they'll move in the next 2 seconds (like a faint ghostly trail). This works even through fog of war if she recently damaged them. Enemies who are more predictable have clearer threads.

### Q: Hex Bolt
Morrigan fires a bolt of cursed energy. If it hits where an enemy's Doom Thread predicted they'd be, it deals 50% bonus damage and briefly reveals them. Missing refunds 50% of the mana cost.

- Cooldown: 5s
- Synergy: Use passive vision to predict and enhance Q

### W: Crone's Cackle
Morrigan cackles, fearing all enemies facing her for 1 second and causing them to turn away. Enemies who were moving toward her are feared for longer (1.5s). Morrigan gains movement speed toward feared enemies.

- Cooldown: 16s
- Synergy: Read Doom Threads, use when enemies approach

### E: Fate Weaving
Morrigan curses an enemy champion, linking their fate to a location for 4 seconds. At the end of the duration (or on recast), the target is pulled back to the linked location. The target can see the link and try to position advantageously.

- Cooldown: 18s
- Synergy: Predict where they'll end up, place abilities there

### R: Prophecy of Doom
Morrigan speaks a prophecy about target enemy champion, revealing their fate. For 8 seconds, that enemy's Doom Threads are visible to Morrigan's entire team, they take 15% increased damage, and if they die during this time, they have increased respawn time. If they survive the full duration without taking significant damage, Morrigan is silenced for 3 seconds.

- Cooldown: 110s
- Synergy: Mark priority target, team can see predictions
